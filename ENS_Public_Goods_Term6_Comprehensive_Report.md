## 2. Funding Strategy Evolution

### 2.1 Two-Pronged Approach

Term 6 formalized a dual funding strategy designed to maximize impact across different scales:

**Strategic Grants** provide substantial, targeted funding ($25,000 - $150,000 USDC) for projects building foundational infrastructure. These grants involve coordinated evaluation with ecosystem partners, particularly the Ethereum Foundation, and include milestone-based disbursement for accountability.

**Builder Grants** offer rapid, accessible funding (0.25 - 4 ETH for small grants, up to 25,000 USDC for large grants) to individual developers and small teams. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, enabling quick decisions that support emerging projects and grassroots innovation.

### 2.2 Ethereum Foundation Alignment

A defining achievement of Term 6 was the operational alignment with the Ethereum Foundation's Funding Coordination team, announced in August 2025. [1] This collaboration addresses long-standing inefficiencies in ecosystem funding:

**Benefits of Co-Funding:**
- Reduced duplication of grant reviews and due diligence
- Extended runway for critical projects through pooled resources
- Stronger ecosystem signaling for supported teams
- Shared transparency standards and reporting frameworks
- Potential model for other ecosystem funders (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)

**Co-Funded Projects in Term 6:**
- Vyper: $50,000 USDC from ENS + matching from EF
- Remix Labs: $50,000 USDC from ENS + EF coordination
- Fabric: $50,000 USDC from ENS + ecosystem matching
- DRC: $150,000 USDC from ENS + ~$300k total planned

This alignment ensures ENS resources are strategically directed toward shared ecosystem priorities while maintaining independence in decision-making.

## 5. Impact Stories: Real-World Outcomes

### 5.1 Revoke.cash: Protecting Users from Token Approval Exploits

**Category:** Security Infrastructure  
**Grant Type:** Builder Grant  
**Website:** [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash)

**The Challenge**

Token approval exploits have cost users millions in lost funds. When users interact with DeFi protocols, they often grant unlimited token approvals to smart contracts. These approvals remain active indefinitely, creating persistent security vulnerabilities. Malicious actors exploit these approvals to drain user funds, and most users lack awareness of the approvals they've granted.

**The Solution**

Revoke.cash provides a free, open-source tool that allows users to view and revoke dangerous token approvals across 100+ blockchain networks. The platform makes security accessible to non-technical users through a simple interface.

**Impact Metrics**

| Metric | Before ENS Support | After ENS Support | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Networks Supported | 50+ | 100+ | +100% |
| Monthly Active Users | ~50,000 | ~150,000 | +200% |
| Approvals Revoked | 500,000+ | 1,000,000+ | +100% |

**External Validation**

Revoke.cash publicly acknowledges ENS Public Goods funding on their [acknowledgements page](https://revoke.cash/acknowledgements), stating: "ENS Public Goods funding has been instrumental in allowing us to continue providing essential web3 security tools without charging users."

**Ecosystem Impact**

By enabling users to manage their security independently, Revoke.cash reduces the attack surface for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Every approval revoked is a potential exploit prevented.

### 5.2 Vyper: Ensuring Compiler Diversity

**Category:** Developer Infrastructure  
**Grant Amount:** $50,000 USDC  
**Co-Funder:** Ethereum Foundation

**The Challenge**

Over $250 billion in TVL depends on Solidity-based smart contracts. While Solidity is mature and well-supported, this monoculture creates systemic risk. A single critical bug in the Solidity compiler could have catastrophic ecosystem-wide consequences affecting thousands of protocols and billions in user funds.

**The Solution**

Vyper provides an alternative smart contract language emphasizing auditability, simplicity, and security through minimalism. By maintaining a viable alternative to Solidity, Vyper ensures the Ethereum ecosystem has compiler diversity, reducing systemic risk.

**Impact Metrics**

| Metric | Before ENS Support | After ENS Support | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Protocols Using Vyper | Major: Curve, Yearn | Expanded ecosystem | Growing adoption |
| TVL in Vyper Contracts | $3.5B | $4.7B | +34% |
| Compiler Releases | Quarterly | Regular updates | Sustained development |

**Strategic Importance**

ENS smart contracts are written in Solidity. Supporting Vyper is not about replacing Solidity but about ensuring the ecosystem has alternatives. This reduces risk for ENS and all Ethereum projects.

**Co-Funding Model**

The Ethereum Foundation's matching support validates Vyper's strategic importance. This co-funding model demonstrates how ENS and EF can pool resources for shared priorities.

---

### 5.3 Fabric: Building Infrastructure for Based Rollups

**Category:** L2 Infrastructure  
**Grant Amount:** $50,000 USDC  
**Strategic Alignment:** Direct support for ENS's Namechain roadmap

**The Challenge**

Based rollups represent the future of Ethereum scaling, providing fast finality while inheriting Ethereum's security. However, the ecosystem lacked standardized infrastructure for validator coordination and pre-confirmations, creating fragmentation and limiting adoption.

**The Solution**

Fabric develops Commit-boost and other critical infrastructure for based rollup coordination. This work creates standards that benefit the entire L2 ecosystem while directly supporting ENS's commitment to launching Namechain as a based rollup.

**Impact Metrics**

| Metric | Before ENS Support | After ENS Support | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Validator Adoption | ~10% | ~30% | +200% |
| Security Audits | 0 | 2 completed | Production-ready |
| Mainnet Validators | Early testing | Thousands | Live on Mainnet |

**Direct ENS Benefit**

This is the most strategically aligned grant for ENS's roadmap. Fabric's infrastructure will directly underpin Namechain's operation as a based rollup. By funding Fabric, ENS is investing in its own future infrastructure while benefiting the broader ecosystem.

**Ecosystem Multiplier**

Fabric's work benefits all based rollups, not just Namechain. This demonstrates how strategic public goods funding creates ecosystem-wide value beyond the direct beneficiary.
